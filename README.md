# Rust and Dust Collector

Another rust training project. Rust and Dust Collector is a very simple dungeon exploration game.
Fight monsters, collect rust and dust, erm, gold! Items! Yes ... and stay alive. You know the drill.

### Install Rust

You need to have Rust installed on your computer to build Rust and Dust Collector from source. Please see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for further instructions. Once Rust is installed, you can compile and start Rust and Dust Collector this way:

    git clone https://github.com/Varkalandar/rust_and_dust.git
    cd rust_and_dust
    cargo run

Cargo is the build tool for Rust. It will download all dependencies needed to compile Rust and Dust Collector and then run the created binary. To just build without running the binary, use "cargo build". "Cargo clean" will delete all artifacts created during the build process.
